## Installation
This section guides you to install all required software and libraries to utilize Build react for your projects fully.

### Node
Node.js® is a JavaScript run time built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js is required to build the Build React. Download the latest version of Node and install it: Download Nodejs

### NPM
NPM is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software registry. NPM is a separate project from Node.js and tends to update more frequently. As a result, even if you’ve just downloaded Node.js (and therefore npm), you’ll probably need to update your NPM .

```
npm install --global npm@latest
```

Verify that npm in successfully installed, and version of installed npm will appear
```
npm --version
```

### Extract and Run
1. First, unzip the zip file that you have download from ThemeForest. You will find a Build-React-1.0 project folder.
2. Then after Extract zip File (Build.zip) into a folder, you have to work within.
3. Open a Node Prompt. Go to your Working Folder, And run the Following Command and wait for finish installation.
    ```
    npm install
    ```
4. This command will install all the required node module into node_module/ inside your working folder.
5. You are ready to run the Build react application for the first time.
6. In the project directory:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    Runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

    The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment
Before the production, specify the production URL in package.json file with homepage attribute, see the below screenshot:

![Deployment](doc-assets/package-json.png)

Then after open node command prompt and go to the project directory. Type following command

```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Available Scripts
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
